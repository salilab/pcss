PCSS is a computational tool for peptide classification using sequence
and structure.

This repository contains the backend protocol that actually performs the
classification. It is not currently functional outside of the Sali lab, as
it relies on several databases and programs in hard-coded locations.

The current best way to use PCSS is to use the
[web interface](https://salilab.org/peptide/).
